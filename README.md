## ❤️ Heart-Disease-Predictor

A machine learning project that predicts the **presence of heart disease** in a patient based on various **medical parameters** like age, cholesterol, and resting blood pressure. This project aims to assist in **early screening** and **decision support** for medical diagnostics.

---

### 🧠 Project Objective
To build an **ML classification model** that:
- Analyzes patient medical data 🩺  
- Predicts the likelihood of heart disease ❤️  
- Provides insights for **preventive healthcare**

---

### 🔧 Technologies Used
- 🐍 Python  
- 🧠 scikit-learn  
- 📊 Pandas & NumPy  
- 🎨 HTML & CSS *(for frontend UI)*  
- 📈 Matplotlib & Seaborn *(for visualizations)*

---

### 🧩 Key Features
- 🧬 Predicts heart disease presence based on:
  - Age
  - Cholesterol
  - Resting blood pressure
  - And other health indicators
- 📥 Accepts user input through a simple **web interface**  
- 🔍 Trained on real medical data for accurate prediction  
- 📊 Visualizes results for better understanding

---

### 🏥 Dataset
- Contains real-world patient data with fields like:
  - Age  
  - Sex  
  - Chest pain type  
  - Resting blood pressure  
  - Serum cholesterol  
  - Fasting blood sugar  
  - Maximum heart rate achieved  
  - Exercise-induced angina  
- Available on platforms like **Kaggle** or **UCI ML Repository**

---

### 🧮 How the Model Works
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and handle missing values  
2. **Feature Selection**: Use relevant medical parameters  
3. **Train-Test Split**: Split data for model evaluation  
4. **Model Training**: Use classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.  
5. **Evaluation**: Use metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score  
6. **Visualization**: Plot confusion matrix, ROC curve, feature importance
